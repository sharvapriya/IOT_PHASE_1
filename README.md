# IOT_PHASE_1
## Phase 1: Problem Definition and Design Thinking
## Problem Definition:
The objective of this project is to set up IOT devices to measure air quality parameters like pollution levels and particulate matter. This data can be made publicly available to raise awareness about air quality and its impact on public health. Air quality monitoring is essential for protecting health, enforcing regulations and responding to emergencies. It guides policy decisions, helps mitigate climate change and fosters public awareness.

## Understanding the problem:
•	Inadequate coverage
•	Outdated Technology
•	Data Interpretation 
•	Sensor Accuracy

## Design thinking:
## Air Quality measuring instruments:
•	Gas Sensors: Detect gases such as CO2, CO, NO2, SO2, O3 and VOCs.
•	Temperature and humidity sensors : Provides data of environmental conditions.
•	Pressure sensors: compensates for atmospheric pressure changes.
•	Particulate matter (PM) sensors: measures concentration of PM2.5 and PM10. 
•	VOC sensors: it measures atmospheric volatile components.

## Data collection and analysis:
•	Sensors at monitoring stations measure air quality parameters.
•	Data is logged and transmitted to a central database 
•	Accuracy is ensured.
•	Pollutant concentrations are compared to required standard. 
## Regulatory compliance:
           Many countries and regions have air regulations in place to limit air pollution, especially in urban areas and near sensitive locations like hospitals and schools. 
           Air pollution monitoring helps ensure that air quality levels comply with these regulations.

## Monitoring locations:
 Air monitoring should be conducted in urban areas, industrial zone, traffic intersections, residential areas, near school and hospitals ,near pollution sources , sensitive areas , weather stations , etc…
Sources of air pollution:
          Pollutants are mainly from transportation , combustion of fuels , industrial activities, chemical reaction , deforestation, volatile oraganic compounds, waste burning, etc…
         Understanding the sources helps in developing  effective control measures.
Public health and environmental impact assessment:
•	Risk of Respiratory and Cardiovascular Problems
•	Reduced Life Expectancy
•	Ecosystem Damage
•	Climate Change, etc…

## Air mitigation:
 Once pollutants and levels are identified, measures can be taken to mitigate. These measures include:
•	Emission Reduction
•	Promote Renewable Energy
•	Reforestation and Green Spaces.

## Community engagement for air pollution:
        Air monitoring data can be shared with public to raise :
•	Education and Awareness
•	Collaborative Initiatives
•	Advocacy and Policy Influence

## Technological advances:
•	Electric Vehicles (EVs)
•	Clean Energy Production

 Long-term trends for air pollution:

## Monitoring over extended periods helps to:
•	Improve Regulations
•	Transition to Clean Energy
•	Technological Advancements, etc…

               Air pollution monitoring is an essential tool for managing and mitigating the adverse effects on human health and the environment. It helps policymakers, urban planners, and environmentalists make informed decisions to create quieter and healthier living environments.
